# Birthday App

This is a (very) simple app, required as part of Makers Academy (week 3). It used Sinatra to create a webapp in ruby.

Running the app
----------------
It should be opened in Chrome. Safari and internet explorer do not support the input type = date.

Testing
-------
* Timecop is used to fix the time on the local machine for reliable testing
* Capybara is used to test that the web app produces the pages required
